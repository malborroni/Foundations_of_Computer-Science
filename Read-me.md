|:------------|:----------------------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Exercise 1  | _Convert the app sizes to a number_                                            | 1            | &#10004;    |

| Exercise 8  | _Create two dataframes: one for the genres and one bridging apps and genres. So that, for instance, the app Pixel Draw - Number Art Coloring Book appears twice in the bridging table, once for Art & Design, once for Creativity_      | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 9  | _For each genre, create a new column of the original dataframe. The new columns must have boolean values (True if the app has a given genre)_                                                                 | 1            | &#10004;    |

| Exercise 11 | _For each app, compute the approximate income, obtain as a product of number of installs and price_         | 1            | &#10004;    |

| Exercise 3  | _For each app, compute the ratio between the number of installs and the number of reviews_                  | 2            | &#10006;    |
| Exercise 4  | _Cluster the apps according to the major android version (the first two digits — e.g. for 4.0.3 the major version is 4.0)_                                                                                | 2           | &#10006;    |

|             |                                                                                 |             |             |
