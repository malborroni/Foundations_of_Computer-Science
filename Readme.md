## &#9741; &nbsp; Overview

Here you can find my solution to a project carried out to complete the examination of a class of the Master's Degree Course in Data Science that I am attending in Milan. <br>
The project consists in the resolution of a certain number of exercises that vary according to the number of the workteam, having two datasets available (that can be found in the "Datasets" section). <br>
In my case, I approached the project individually, so I only had to resolve the first 12 exercises.

## &#9741; &nbsp; Instructions

Starting from the *Google Play Store dataset*, all groups and individuals must do the following:



| References  | To do list                                                                     | Team size    | Status      |
|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|

| Exercise 5  | _Remove the duplicates_                                                        | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 6  | _For each category, compute the number of apps_                                | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 7  | _For each category, compute the average rating_                                | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 8  | _Create two dataframes: one for the genres and one bridging apps and genres. So that, for instance, the app Pixel Draw - Number Art Coloring Book appears twice in the bridging table, once for Art & Design, once for Creativity_      | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 9  | _For each genre, create a new column of the original dataframe. The new columns must have boolean values (True if the app has a given genre)_                                                                 | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 10 | _For each genre, compute the average rating. What is the genre with highest average?_                       | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 11 | _For each app, compute the approximate income, obtain as a product of number of installs and price_         | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 12 |  _For each app, compute its minimum and maximum Sentiment_polarity_             | 1           | &#10004;    |
|             |                                                                                 |             |             |

| Exercise 3  | _For each app, compute the ratio between the number of installs and the number of reviews_                  | 2            | &#10006;    |
| Exercise 4  | _Cluster the apps according to the major android version (the first two digits — e.g. for 4.0.3 the major version is 4.0)_                                                                                | 2           | &#10006;    |
| Exercise 5  | _For each cluster, compute the average date and the last date of an update._    | 2           | &#10006;    |
| Exercise 6  | _Excluding the free apps, what is the content rating with highest average price?_                           | 2   | &#10006;    |
|             |                                                                                 |             |             |
| Exercise 1  | _What is the genre with the highest total income?_                              | 3           | &#10006;    |
| Exercise 2  | _What is the genre with the highest fraction of free apps (over the number of all apps)?_                   | 3   | &#10006;    |
| Exercise 3  | _For each rating, compute the average income_                                   | 3           | &#10006;    |
| Exercise 4  | _For each (Content Rating, Genre) pair, compute the number of reviews and the average rating_               | 3   | &#10006;    | 

### **Notes**

1. It is mandatory to use [GitHub](https://github.com) for developing the project;
